Our research question is:  How do different governments' policies affect protests during the pandemic? During the COVID-19 pandemic, existing socio-economic differences between and within countries became apparent. Consequently, the publics started responding differently to their governments' Covid-19 lockdown measures. However, in the literature, not much attention has been given to the relationship between social movements and the pandemic. That is why, analyzing the public responses from the United States of America, Argentina, and South Africa, we aim to understand how people from different countries from different socio-economic backgrounds respond to their governments' lockdown measures.
